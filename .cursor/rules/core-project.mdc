- Always follow general Ruby best practices: SRP, snake_case, readability, and short methods.
- Use `bundler`, `rspec`, and `rubocop`; ensure tests and lint pass.
- When adding new features, maintain backward compatibility.
- Cover any changes with tests (unit and edge cases) before implementation.
