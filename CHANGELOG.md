All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.1.0] - 2025-XX-XX

### Changed
- **Logging and Security**: Migrated to a single middleware (`SanitizedLogsMiddleware`) for all HTTP request/response logging and masking.
  - Now, *all* HTTP logs (when `DEBUG_GASFREE_SDK=1`) are guaranteed to be sanitized before output, with no risk of leaking sensitive data.
  - No other HTTP logging middleware is used, ensuring complete control over log output.

### Security
- **Stronger Data Protection**: Sensitive fields (private keys, tokens, signatures, etc.) are always masked in logs, even in debug mode. No original data is ever written to logs.

### Specs & Documentation
- Updated README to reflect the new logging architecture and usage.

### Added
- **TronEIP712Signer Module**: Complete EIP-712 signature implementation for TRON GasFree transfers
  - Full EIP-712 structured data signing according to TIP-712 specifications
  - Support for both TRON Mainnet and Testnet (Nile) networks
  - Built-in Keccak256 cryptographic hashing implementation
  - Base58 encoding/decoding utilities for TRON addresses
  - Flexible data key handling (camelCase, snake_case conversion)
  - Pre-configured domain constants for GasFree contracts
  - Comprehensive test coverage with RSpec

- **Core GasFree SDK functionality**
  - API client for GasFree.io with support for different endpoints (mainnet, testnet, custom)
  - Support for tokens, providers, and transfer operations
  - Comprehensive error handling and validation
  - Ethereum and TRON address support
  - RSpec test suite with comprehensive coverage
  - Dry-rb validation and type checking

### Features
- `GasfreeSdk::TronEIP712Signer.sign_typed_data_testnet()` - Sign for TRON Testnet
- `GasfreeSdk::TronEIP712Signer.sign_typed_data_mainnet()` - Sign for TRON Mainnet
- `GasfreeSdk::TronEIP712Signer.sign_typed_data()` - Generic signing with custom domains
- `GasfreeSdk::Crypto::Keccak256` - Pure Ruby Keccak256 implementation
- `GasfreeSdk::Base58` - TRON address encoding/decoding utilities
- Token, Provider, and Transfer management APIs
- Service Providers API with proper data mapping from camelCase to snake_case
- Improved URL path handling for API requests

### Dependencies
- Added `rbsecp256k1` (~> 6.0) for secp256k1 cryptographic operations

### Examples
- `examples/simple_usage_example.rb` - Basic TronEIP712Signer usage demonstration
- `examples/test_tron_signer.rb` - Comprehensive module testing script
- Updated `examples/test_with_real_data_prod.rb` to use the new module

### Documentation
- Updated README.md with comprehensive TronEIP712Signer documentation
- Added usage examples and API reference
- Documented all cryptographic operations and utilities
- Improved documentation for Service Providers with detailed configuration constraints

### Fixed
- Fixed Service Providers API data mapping from camelCase to snake_case
- Added proper transformation for provider configuration fields (maxPendingTransfer -> max_pending_transfer, etc.)
- Updated tests to use correct API response format for providers

### Enhanced
- Comprehensive test coverage for provider field mapping
- RSpec testing framework integration
- Improved error handling and validation throughout the SDK
